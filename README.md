# Shape-Function-Engine
A powerful C library for finding the shape functions of any point with respect to a triangle or quadrilateral.                 
Given a point and a polygon, the library runs to find the bilinear mapping parametric co-ordinates in case of quadrilateral and the Barycentric co-ordinates in case of a triangle.
