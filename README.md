# Inverse Mapping Algorithm for Bilinear Quadrilateral
A powerful C library for finding the parametric co-ordinates of bilinear mapping for any given point with respect to a quadrilateral. These are parametric co-ordinates are also utilised in calculating the interpolation functions or shape functions. The library also helps in evaluating the Barycentric co-ordinates of a point in case of a triangle.
