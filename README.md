# Inverse Mapping Algorithm for Bilinear Interpolation of Quadrilaterals
A powerful C library for finding the parametric co-ordinates of bilinear mapping for any given point with respect to a quadrilateral. These parametric co-ordinates are also utilised in calculating the interpolation functions or shape functions at the given point. The library also helps in evaluating the Barycentric co-ordinates of a point in case of a triangle.

# Overview
Given a point and a quadrilateral in the physical space, the function $\phi^{-1}(x)$ defines the inverse mapping to a corresponding point in the parametric space. The algorithm calculates the parametric co-ordinates $(\xi_1,\xi_2)$ corresponding to the given point $(x,y)$ in the physical space through this inverse mapping.

# Features
* Compute parametric coordinates for any given point with respect to a bilinear quadrilateral.
* Calculate interpolation functions (shape functions) at a given point.
* Evaluate Barycentric coordinates for points within triangles.
* Analytical solution that avoids convergence issues commonly encountered in iterative schemes.
* Approximately 2.5 times faster than Newtonâ€™s iterative method for quadrilaterals with non-parallel opposite sides.
