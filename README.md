# Inverse Mapping Algorithm for Bilinear Quadrilateral
A powerful C library for finding the parametric co-ordinates of bilinear mapping for any given point with respect to a quadrilateral. These parametric co-ordinates are also utilised in calculating the interpolation functions or shape functions at the given point. The library also helps in evaluating the Barycentric co-ordinates of a point in case of a triangle.


## Installation
To install the library, simply clone this repository and include the header files in your project. Make sure to link the library during compilation.

Refer to examples in this repository for a quick guide on this library's utility.
